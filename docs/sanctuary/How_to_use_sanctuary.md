# How to Use Sanctuary

**Product:** Panchnity  
**Feature:** Sanctuary  
**Access:** Available when enabled for your account

## What Is Sanctuary?

Sanctuary is a **temporary, anonymous space** inside _Panchnity_ where you can release thoughts or feelings without judgment, identity, or permanence.

It is not a chat, community, or profile-based feature.  
It exists so you can say something safely — and then let it go.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Log in to Panchnity

You must be logged in to use Sanctuary.

Sanctuary is anonymous **inside** Panchnity, but it is not available to logged-out users.

---

### 2. Enter Sanctuary

From the app, choose **“Vent anonymously”**  
(or open `/sanctuary` if it’s enabled for you).

You’ll see a calm screen with copy like:

> _A temporary space for your thoughts._

There are no profiles, no history, and no expectations.

---

### 3. Anonymous identity (automatic)

The first time you enter Sanctuary:

- An anonymous name is generated for you (for example, _Quiet River_)
- A neutral color is assigned
- You cannot edit or customize this identity

This identity:

- Exists **only inside Sanctuary**
- Is never shown elsewhere in Panchnity
- Cannot be linked back to you by other users

You don’t need to set anything up — it happens automatically.

---

### 4. Write a vent

Tap **“Vent anonymously”**.

You’ll see a simple text box with a message like:

> _Share it safely. It won’t stay._

Rules:

- Text only
- Maximum 280 characters
- One active vent at a time

Write what you need to get out.

---

### 5. Post and release

When you submit:

- Your vent appears in the Sanctuary feed
- It will automatically disappear after **24 hours**
- You cannot edit or retrieve it later

There is nothing to manage and nothing to maintain.

---

### 6. Acknowledge others (optional)

You may see other anonymous vents from the last 24 hours.

You can acknowledge them with a single emoji:

- 🤍 Support
- 🤗 Hug
- 😔 Same
- 👂 Listening

You cannot:

- Reply
- Start conversations
- See who reacted
- See reaction counts

Acknowledgment is quiet and one-way.

---

### 7. Leave Sanctuary

At any time, choose **“Return to Panchnity”**.

You may see a reminder like:

> _You’re not alone. This will pass. You still belong._

There are no prompts to stay or come back.

---

## Important Things to Know

- All vents disappear automatically after 24 hours
- No one can see who you are
- There is no history or archive
- You are never expected to return

Sanctuary is available when you need it — and quiet when you don’t.

## In One Sentence

**Sanctuary is for saying the thing you’re not ready to carry into the world — and then letting it go.**
